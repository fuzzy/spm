    /*
      This file of course builds nothing, but is here to show you how a specfile
      is written. It's pretty standard fare, nothing crazy or wildly different from
      things like a rpm specfiles, or homebrew recipes (altho not in ruby).

      Some rules to keep in mind:

      1) All options are required.
      2) Any value you have defined below, is available as a macro, there are other
      macros available by default, they will documented elsewhere, and are referenced
      with the syntax: $(macro) and it should be noted that macro names are *ALWAYS*
      lower case.
      3) Any environment variable can be referenced with the syntax: ${ENVVAR}
