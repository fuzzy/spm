  # This file of course builds nothing, but is here to show you how a specfile
  # is written. It's pretty standard fare, nothing crazy or wildly different from
  # things like a rpm specfiles, or homebrew recipes (altho not in ruby).
  #
  # Some rules to keep in mind:
  #
  # 1) All options are required.
  # 2) Any value you have defined below, is available as a macro, there are other
  #    macros available by default, they will documented elsewhere, and are referenced
  #    with the syntax: $(macro) and it should be noted that macro names are *ALWAYS*
  #    lower case.
  # 3) Any environment variable can be referenced with the syntax: ${ENVVAR}
